								<h3>The Purpose of this Site</h3>

								Hey there! The purpose of this site is to tell a different story than what a resume or cover-letter would. Because of this I wont be focusing on my work, but instead, aspects of my life I'd like to share. Feel free to contact me <a alt="Contact Me" href="mailto:benwagrez@gmail.com">benwagrez@gmail.com</a> for any questions or suggestions!

								<h3>Born in Chicago, Brought the Cloud Everywhere</h3>

								A born-and-raised Chicagoan with a penchant for making the cloud my playground. My journey has taken me from the windy city to the tech hubs of Seattle, New York, and the beautiful waters of Tampa.

								<h3>Cloud Architect Expert</h3>

								By day, I'm a certified cloud architect, weaving digital dreams in the realms of sysops, devops, and infrastructure automation. With a background in consulting, I've architected optimized environments for a large number of different business use-cases.

								Did you know this website is being hosted on AWS? Checkout my github for the code!

								<h3>Tech Tinkerer, Homelab Enthusiast</h3>

								When the sun sets on the tech world, you'll find me knee-deep in hobbies that range from tinkering with my K8s cluster homelab to programming in my AWS sandbox. 

								<h3>Eternal Student & Teacher</h3>

								‘Any fool can know. The point is to understand.’ –Albert Einstein. I thrive on challenging myself. From hackathons early on during my academics to leading previosuly unpaved projects with major clients, there is no greater learning opportunity than putting yourself in the position to grow.

								Following in the same footsteps, a student has truly reached understanding when they have become a teacher. In this spirit I enjoy the opportunity to learn from and teach those around me. The most valuable trait one can have, and one I strive for, is to be open-minded and malleable.

								<p>A glimpse into my bucket hat addiction</p>
							</header>
							<p  class="square" id="gegertaes">
								I still can't believe I went to a music festival in Belgium. Or a month in Mexico city? I feel extremely fortunate to have had these opportunities in my life. Some of my favorite journeys have taken me all around the U.S., one road trip at a time. From witnessing sunsets that paint the sky with fire to sipping coffee amidst New York's hustle, and even discovering hidden corners of Chicago and Tampa – each experience has been a treasured gem.
								Ifind that my bucket list is always evolving as I tick them offone by one, and I still have a lifetime of journey's ahead of me. 
								If I had one takeaway from my experience so far it would be this. Embrace the hustle, nurture your passions, and don't be afraid to leave your comfort zone. The journey is unpredictable, but it's uniquely yours... And get a bucket hat they look cool.

								<h2>Wintersports</h2>
								<p>I flipped that snowmobile...</p>
							</header>
							<p class="square" id="gegertaes">
								Picture this: the wilds of Alaska, a snowmobiler's dream come true. The roar of the engine, the crisp air, and the untouched terrain beneath – it's a symphony of freedom. My snowmobiling escapade in Alaska felt like a dance between man and machine.
								That is... until I got thrown off head first into snow with my ride piling on top of me. 
								But that's just the beginning. I've chased the snowboarding thrill down the slopes of Washington and Colorado, at some of the most renowned resorts in the world. The mountains called, and I answered with my trusty snowboard in tow (actually I snapped it in two at a double black diamond at Whistler). Each descent was an adrenaline rush, a symphony of speed, skill, and falling on my butt and tumbling down the mountain.
								To my fellow snow comrades, may your lines be clean, your rides be epic, and your memories be hella rad.

								<h2>Boxing</h2>
								<p>Like Rocky Balboa but not good</p>
							</header>
							<p class="square" id="gegertaes">
								"To see a man beaten not by a better opponent but by himself is a tragedy." — Cus D'Amato. Boxing feels like more than just a sport; it's more akin to a metaphor for life's battles. Each jab, hook, and uppercut is a testament to ones willpower, echoing Rocky's mantra that "It ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward." 
								I've come to appreciate the sport more than I thought I ever could. At the end of the day, it's difficult to find a unifying experience like the sport of boxing.

							</header>
							<p class="square" id="gegertaes">
								If you're looking to conquer the kitchen, remember this: cooking is a journey that requires patience, practice, and an insatiable appetite for improvement.
								My journey for self-improvement in cooking came out as I began to cook for family and friends. I was bad, and they kindly let me know. The only claim to fame my tastebuds have is that they didn't mind my cooking. But I figured if I'll be cooking for the rest of my life I better be pretty dang good at it.
								Now I aspire to be as talented as the pictured dog-chef...

									A ragtag team of old equipment I've gathered over the years

							</header>
							<p class="square" id="gegertaes">
								Before I took my homelab down for my move to Tampa, my homelab consisted of two Raspberry Pis and one Win 10 box running 3 Ubuntu Virtual Machines. I created a K8s cluster of the two Pis and 3 VMs over my home wifi network and toyed with initially hosting this website on that cluster. 
								I quickly learned that Raspberry Pi 2 did not like modern security requirements on WIFI, you can hardcode some of the attributes required but if the NIC goes to sleep or shuts off, it will refuse to negotiate with the router. Hopefully upgrades and a cooler project is coming soon!
